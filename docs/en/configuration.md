# Configuration Reference

[简体中文](../zh-CN/configuration.md) | **English** | [Documentation Center](./README.md)

## Configuration Location and Activation

The plugin registers the `mnemon` namespace with the DSH settings service. User configuration is stored in:

```text
$DSH_HOME/settings.yaml
```

The default is commonly `~/.dsh/settings.yaml`. All current settings are marked as taking effect on `restart`; restart the DSH Host after saving them.

The Web settings card edits only `storageScope` and `dataDir`. Other advanced settings must be changed directly in YAML.

## Complete Example

```yaml
mnemon:
  storageScope: global # global | workspace | custom
  # dataDir: ~/mnemon-data       # required for custom
  # cliPath: /opt/homebrew/bin/mnemon
  # store: legacy-store          # compatibility discovery hint, not a regular routing target
  timeoutMs: 10000
  defaultRecallLimit: 10
  routingGuidance: true
  lifecycleEnabled: true
  runtimeMemoryMode: session-revision # session-revision | every-turn | off
  recallMode: guided
  lifecycleCueMode: session # session | every-turn | off
  writebackMode: guided
  idleReviewMs: 30000
  tabEnabled: true
  writeEnabled: true
```

## Options

| Setting | Default | Range | Implementation Semantics |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `storageScope` | `global` | `global` / `workspace` / `custom` | Controls the root for Runtime, Documents, Memory Spaces, and reserved state as one unit |
| `dataDir` | unset | absolute path, `~`, or `~/...` | Required for `custom`; legacy configurations that set only this option automatically resolve to `custom` |
| `cliPath` | auto-discovered | executable path | Explicitly selects the Mnemon CLI |
| `store` | unset | `[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9_-]*` | Compatibility discovery/preference hint for legacy Stores; semantic operations are routed through Memory Spaces |
| `timeoutMs` | `10000` | 100–120000 ms | Hard timeout for a single CLI call |
| `defaultRecallLimit` | `10` | 1–50 | Default recall count for the service and UI; individual entry points may impose a lower limit |
| `routingGuidance` | `true` | boolean | Whether to register an additional tiered-routing system section |
| `lifecycleEnabled` | `true` | boolean | Whether to enable the pre-step cue and score-based background review |
| `runtimeMemoryMode` | `session-revision` | `session-revision` / `every-turn` / `off` | Whether USER.md/MEMORY.md load at session start and revision changes, every turn, or never |
| `recallMode` | `guided` | `guided` / `off` | Whether to enable the recall cue; does not remove explicit recall |
| `lifecycleCueMode` | `session` | `session` / `every-turn` / `off` | Whether the memory reminder appears once per session, every turn, or never |
| `writebackMode` | `guided` | `guided` / `off` | Whether to inject the hot-memory cue and enable score-based background review; does not remove explicit writes |
| `idleReviewMs` | `30000` | 5000–600000 ms | Required continuous idle time after the threshold is reached |
| `tabEnabled` | `true` | boolean | Currently gates only Host Mnemon data RPC; the client Tab is still registered—see the limitation below |
| `writeEnabled` | `true` | boolean | Whether to expose semantic write tools, write RPC, and write commands |

## Storage Scopes

### `global`

```text
MNEMON_DATA_DIR when non-empty
  otherwise ~/.mnemon
```

Suitable for users who want Runtime, Documents, and Memory Spaces shared across multiple workspaces.

### `workspace`

```text
resolve(process.cwd(), ".mnemon")
```

Here, cwd is the DSH Host process launch directory. It is not the current browser-page directory and does not necessarily match the cwd recorded for every session. Start DSH from the target project directory.

### `custom`

```yaml
mnemon:
  storageScope: custom
  dataDir: /absolute/path/to/mnemon-data
```

`~` and `~/...` are also allowed. Relative paths are rejected.

## CLI Discovery Precedence

```text
config.cliPath
  -> executable MNEMON_CLI_PATH
  -> each PATH directory
  -> ~/.local/bin/mnemon
  -> /opt/homebrew/bin/mnemon
  -> /usr/local/bin/mnemon
  -> /usr/bin/mnemon
```

An explicit `cliPath` is accepted as configured; if it is not executable, actual calls return a launch error.

## Compatibility Store Hint Precedence

```text
config.store
  -> MNEMON_STORE
  -> <storageRoot>/active
  -> default
```

After the Memory Space directory has been established, long-term semantic operations use explicit Memory Space IDs and do not rely on the global active Store for routing.

## Provider Requirements

Regular workers prefer `spawn`. If no provider has that name, another provider with all of the following capabilities can be selected:

```text
outputSchema = true
toolFilter   = true
persona      = true
depthLimit   = true
```

Background review has no fallback: a compatible provider named `fork` must exist and must have:

```text
inheritsParentContext = true
```

A missing `fork` does not block deterministic state or regular UI reads, but a subagent failure is recorded when the review threshold is reached.

## Read-Only Configuration

```yaml
mnemon:
  writeEnabled: false
```

Effects:

- Model write tools are not registered;
- `/dsh-mnemon-write` RPC is not registered;
- `/mnemon remember` and `/mnemon forget` are rejected;
- semantic mutations through `MnemonService` are rejected.

This is feature-level read-only behavior, not a read-only filesystem mode: the Runtime controller may still initialize or repair projections, Document search updates LRU access times, and Mnemon read commands may trigger upstream database migrations. Do not treat `writeEnabled=false` as a safety guarantee for read-only mounts.

## Switch Interactions

```text
writeEnabled=false
  -> overrides all explicit semantic writes

writebackMode=off
  -> no write cue, no scored review
  -> explicit writes remain when writeEnabled=true

recallMode=off
  -> no recall cue
  -> explicit recall remains

lifecycleEnabled=false
  -> no lifecycle cues or review
  -> UI, commands, and explicit tools remain

routingGuidance=false
  -> removes only mnemon:routing
  -> runtime-memory prompt section remains
```

## Current `tabEnabled` Limitation

When `tabEnabled=false`, the Host does not register Mnemon read/write RPC, but the Web client still registers its conversation view slot unconditionally. The current result is therefore “the Tab entry may still appear while its data interface is unavailable,” not complete Tab removal. This is an implementation gap; do not rely on the setting to uninstall the UI.

## Profile Patch Overrides

The bundled `cordis.patch.yml` provides the default config row. A DSH profile configuration with the same ID may replace that row as a whole. When customizing a patch, retain every key that must remain enabled instead of assuming a deep merge.

## Common Configurations

Workspace isolation:

```yaml
mnemon:
  storageScope: workspace
```

A custom data volume and a longer CLI timeout:

```yaml
mnemon:
  storageScope: custom
  dataDir: /Volumes/AgentData/mnemon
  timeoutMs: 30000
```

Keep explicit tools while disabling lifecycle behavior:

```yaml
mnemon:
  lifecycleEnabled: false
```

Disable only background writeback decisions:

```yaml
mnemon:
  writebackMode: off
```
